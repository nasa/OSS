| --- | --- | --- |
| actions | <code>Object</code> | What actions is the current user allowed to perform? |

| actions.updateGroup | <code>boolean</code> | Is the current user allowed to updated groups? |
| filters | <code>Object</code> | What filters should be preemptively applied to the groups? This is a hashmap where each  property name matches the property name for a group; the value can be a string or a function. If a string, the  property value must be an exact match; for instance, if `filters.OwnerTitle` is provided, this instance of the  application will only allow the user to manage groups which OwnerTitle matches that value. If a function, the group  metadata will be passed to the function and the application will only allow the user to manage groups for which the  function returns a truthy value. |
